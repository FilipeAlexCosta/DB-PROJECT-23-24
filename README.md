### About

This repo contains the second delivery of the Databases course @ IST. The first delivery was focused on EA modelling, relational algebra, etc...

This is just the "core", that is, many of the other components needed to run the project are missing (although you might be able to find some of the missing pieces by looking at the commit history ;)).

Finally, in case you haven't noticed, most of the contents are in Portuguese, since we didn't really plan on making it public.

Have fun!
